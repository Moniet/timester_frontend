# TIMESTER
Timester is a task managing app that aims to promote a goal oriented approach to
managing tasks.

Once you've created an account and signed in, you can create tasks like so:

After creating your goals they will show up on the home page:

You can also use the calendar to see tasks completed on a particular day:

Clicking a date on the calendar will open a page that will look like this (it shows all the tasks for that day)

Clicking on a task will show the goals page. 
In the goals page the animation of the river shows the time left for each task.
Additionally the timeline helps you visualise time based on the length of the task. 
The timeline will be longer for more time consuming tasks.
